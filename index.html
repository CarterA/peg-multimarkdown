<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This document is a guide to understanding and using MultiMarkdown. It was
created as a <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown/wiki/User's-Manual">wiki</a>, and thus was written by various contributors. Feel free
to contribute your own improvements!</p>

<h3 id="whatismarkdown">What is Markdown?</h3>

<p>To understand what MultiMarkdown is, you first should be familiar with
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" title="Daring Fireball:
Markdown">Markdown</a>. The best description of what Markdown is comes from John Gruber&#8217;s
Markdown web site:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown
allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text
format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).</p>

<p>Thus, &#8220;Markdown&#8221; is two things: (1) a plain text formatting
syntax; and (2) a software tool, written in Perl, that converts
the plain text formatting to HTML. See the Syntax page for details
pertaining to Markdown’s formatting syntax. You can try it out,
right now, using the online Dingus.</p>

<p>The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to
make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted
document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking
like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While
Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing
text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for
Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email. &#8212; <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" title="Daring Fireball: Markdown">John Gruber</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="anoteonplaintextformatting">A note on Plain Text Formatting</h3>

<p>The value of Markdown is that it allows the writer to focus completely on the
process of writing and not on formatting their text. Many &#8220;word processors&#8221;
are actually programs that provide writing tools, but also text formatting,
page layout, image handling, commenting and editing tools. However these tools
obscure the original purpose of simply <em>writing</em> something.</p>

<p>Markdown and MultiMarkdown are not for everyone. But if you find yourself
being frustrated by the hurdles most word processors create, using
MultiMarkdown and plain text may be the solution you&#8217;re looking for.</p>

<h3 id="whatismultimarkdown">What is MultiMarkdown?</h3>

<p>Markdown is great, but it lacked a few features that would allow it to work
with documents, rather than just pieces of a web page.</p>

<p>I wrote MultiMarkdown in order to leverage Markdown&#8217;s syntax, but to extend it
to work with complete documents that could ultimately be converted from text
into other formats, including complete XHTML documents, LaTeX, PDF, RTF, or
even (shudder) Microsoft Word documents. These various formats are supported
to varying degrees by various versions of MultiMarkdown and work differently
on different operating systems. The two <em>core</em> output formats are XHTML and
LaTeX (for now at least).</p>

<p>In addition to the ability to work with complete documents and conversion to
other formats, the Markdown syntax was lacking a few things. Michel Fortin
added a few additional syntax tools when writing <a href="http://www.michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/extra/">PHP Markdown Extra</a>. Some
of his ideas were implemented and expanded on in MultiMarkdown, in addition to
more features not available in other Markdown implementations. These features
include tables, footnotes, citation support, image and link attributes,
cross-references, math support, and more.</p>

<p>John Gruber may disagree with me, but I really did try to stick with his
proclaimed vision whenever I added a new syntax format to MultiMarkdown. The
quality that attracted me to Markdown the most was its clean format. Reading a
plain text document written in Markdown is <em>easy</em>. It makes sense, and it
looks like it was designed for people, not computers. To the extent possible,
I tried to keep this same concept in mind when working on MultiMarkdown.</p>

<p>I may or may not have succeeded in this&#8230;.</p>

<p>In the vein of Markdown&#8217;s multiple definitions, you can think of MultiMarkdown
as:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A program to convert plain text to XHTML (or LaTeX).</p></li>
<li><p>The syntax used in the plain text to describe how to convert it to XHTML</p></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="anexample">An Example</h3>

<p>Sometimes an example is the best way to describe something. Here is an example of some text written in XHTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;In order to create valid 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt;, you 
need properly coded syntax that can be cumbersome for 
&amp;#8220;non-programmers&amp;#8221; to write. Sometimes, you
just want to easily make certain words &lt;strong&gt;bold
&lt;/strong&gt;, and certain words &lt;em&gt;italicized&lt;/em&gt; without
having to remember the syntax. Additionally, for example,
creating lists:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;should be easy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;should not involve programming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And here is the MultiMarkdown text that can produce the same output:</p>

<pre><code>In order to create valid [HTML][], you need properly
coded syntax that can be cumbersome for 
&quot;non-programmers&quot; to write. Sometimes, you just want
to easily make certain words **bold**, and certain 
words *italicized* without having to remember the 
syntax. Additionally, for example, creating lists:

* should be easy
* should not involve programming

[HTML]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML
</code></pre>

<p>Decide for yourself which you think is easier to read, write, and remember&#8230;.</p>

<h3 id="whereisthisguidekept">Where is this Guide Kept?</h3>

<p>This User&#8217;s Guide is designed to be viewed as a single XHTML document, or as a
PDF after being processed by LaTeX. When processed by MultiMarkdown and
combined as a single document, it will demonstrate many of the features that
MultiMarkdown offers, and should be fairly easy to navigate.</p>

<p>The source text documents are actually stored in a wiki on Github so that the
document can easily be worked on by anyone with a Github account:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown/wiki/User's-Manual">https://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown/wiki/User's-Manual</a></p>

<p><em>Note</em>: Currently, the Github wiki software supports Markdown, but not
MultiMarkdown. This means that certain MultiMarkdown specific features will
not work on the wiki, but will work when the source is processed by
MultiMarkdown separately from the wiki.</p>

<p>You can download a copy of the source files using the instructions contained
at the wiki itself. Additionally, the source is linked to from within the
source project for MultiMarkdown in the <code>documentation</code> directory. If you
download the source, you can can compile a copy of the documentation
automatically with:</p>

<pre><code>make docs
</code></pre>

<p>(This command requires perl to be installed &#8212; maybe at some point I&#8217;ll work
on an alternative for Windows users without perl).</p>

<h2 id="howdoiinstallmultimarkdown">How do I install MultiMarkdown?</h2>

<h3 id="macosx">Mac OS X</h3>

<p>The easiest way to install MultiMarkdown on the Mac is to use the installer
from the <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown/downloads/">downloads</a> page. Simply choose the latest version of the
MultiMarkdown-Mac zipfile and download it. Double-click the file to unzip it,
and then double click the installer that appears.</p>

<p>If you primarily intend to use MultiMarkdown from within <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>, or
<a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/">Scrivener</a>, you may wish to also download and install the Support files. This
places additional convenience scripts in <code>~/Library/Application
Support/MultiMarkdown</code> which is where Scrivener and TextMate will generally
look for it. This installer is also available from the <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown/downloads/">downloads</a> page.</p>

<p>For more advanced users, the installer puts the <code>multimarkdown</code> binary and two
convenience scripts, <code>mmd</code> and <code>mmd2tex</code> in the <code>/usr/local/bin</code> directory. As
long as <code>/usr/local/bin</code> is included in your PATH environment variable, you
can use these binaries from the command line or from other programs.</p>

<p>If you wish to compile MultiMarkdown from source for yourself:</p>

<ul>
<li>make sure you have installed the Developer Tools</li>
<li>you will need to install several libraries:

<ul>
<li><code>brew install pkg-config glib gettext</code></li>
<li>OR</li>
<li><code>fink install glib2-shlibs glib2-dev</code></li>
<li>OR a similar alternative</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>git clone git://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown.git</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Then you can compile:</p>

<pre><code>make
make test
make mmdtest
make latextest
</code></pre>

<p>Then simply move the binary and convenience scripts to your desired location.</p>

<h3 id="linux">Linux</h3>

<p>There is no installer for *nix systems, but you can compile from source fairly
easily. For example, on <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev git
git clone git://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown.git
make
make test
make mmdtest
make latextest
</code></pre>

<p>Other flavors of linux will require variations of the first command.</p>

<p>Then just put the binaries wherever you like.</p>

<h3 id="windows">Windows</h3>

<p>The easiest way to install MultiMarkdown on Windows is to download the Windows
installer package from the <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown/downloads/">downloads</a> page. The installer is built using
software by <a href="http://bitrock.com/">BitRock</a>.</p>

<p>Just as with the Mac version, the <code>multimarkdown</code> binary, as well as several
convenience scripts are installed for use from the command line.</p>

<p>If you want to compile from source for yourself, check out the instructions on
the <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown/wiki/Building-for-Windows">wiki</a>.</p>

<h3 id="multimarkdownsupportfiles">MultiMarkdown Support Files</h3>

<p>In addition to the basic installation, there are optional support files that
can be installed to add additional features to MultiMarkdown. These can be
download from the <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/MMD-Support">MMD-Support</a> project page.</p>

<p>This package includes a few extra convenience scripts related to processing
OPML files, and for using XSLT to process XHTML into LaTeX.</p>

<p>On a Mac, these should be installed in <code>~/Library/Application
Support/MultiMarkdown</code>. There is not a designated location yet for Windows or
*nix systems.</p>

<h3 id="latexsupportfiles">LaTeX Support Files</h3>

<p>If you plan on creating LaTeX files from your MultiMarkdown documents, I
suggest installing the <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown-latex-support">LaTeX Support Files</a>. These include the various
default include files so that the MultiMarkdown sample documents can be
compiled, and provide basic support for the default metadata fields.</p>

<h2 id="howdoiusemultimarkdown">How do I use MultiMarkdown?</h2>

<p>There are several ways to use MultiMarkdown, depending on your needs. You can
use the <code>multimarkdown</code> command line tool, you can use MultiMarkdown with
several applications that support it directly, or you can use a drag and drop
approach.</p>

<h3 id="commandlineusage">Command Line Usage</h3>

<p>First, verify that you have properly installed MultiMarkdown:</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown -v
</code></pre>

<p>If you don&#8217;t see a message telling you which version of MultiMarkdown is
installed, check out Troubleshooting.</p>

<p>To learn more about the command line options to multimarkdown:</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown -h
</code></pre>

<p>Once you have properly installed MultiMarkdown:</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>will convert the plain text file <code>file.txt</code> into XHTML output. To save the
results to a file:</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown file.txt &gt; file.html
</code></pre>

<p>A shortcut to this is to use MultiMarkdown&#8217;s batch mode, which will save the
output to the same base filename that is input, with the extension <code>.html</code> (or
<code>.tex</code> for LaTeX output):</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown -b file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>A benefit of batch mode is that you can process multiple files at once:</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown -b file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to create LaTeX output instead of XHTML:</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown -t latex file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>For OPML:</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown -t opml file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>And for an OpenDocument text file:</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown -t odf file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>There are also several convenience scripts included with MultiMarkdown:</p>

<pre><code>mmd file.txt
mmd2tex file.txt
mmd2opml file.txt
mmd2odf file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>These scripts run MultiMarkdown in batch mode to generate XHTML, LaTeX, OPML,
or ODF files respectively. These scripts are included with the Mac or Windows
installers, and are available for *nix in the <code>scripts</code> directory in the
source project. They are intended to be used as shortcuts for the most common
command line options.</p>

<h4 id="commandlineoptions">Command Line Options</h4>

<p>There are several options when running MultiMarkdown from the command line.</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown -c, multimarkdown --compatibility
</code></pre>

<p>Compatibility mode causes MultiMarkdown to output XHTML that is compatible
with that output from the original Markdown. This allows it to pass the
original Markdown test suite. Syntax features that don&#8217;t exist in regular
Markdown will still be output using the regular MultiMarkdown output
formatting.</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown -e &quot;metakey&quot;, multimarkdown --extract &quot;metakey&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>The extract feature outputs the value of the specified metadata key. This is
used in my convenience scripts to help choose the proper LaTeX output mode,
and could be used in other circumstances as well.</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown -t html|latex|memoir|beamer|opml|odf
</code></pre>

<p>This options specified the format that MultiMarkdown outputs. The default is
html. If you use the <code>LaTeX Mode</code> metadata, then MultiMarkdown will
automatically choose <code>memoir</code> or <code>beamer</code> as directed without using these
command line options. Using that metadata will also allow the various
convenience scripts to choose the correct output format as well.</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown --process-html
</code></pre>

<p>This option tells MultiMarkdown to process the text included within HTML tags
in the source document.</p>

<p>Other options are available by checking out <code>multimarkdown --help-all</code>, but
the ones listed above are the primary options.</p>

<p>TODO: need to describe more options</p>

<h4 id="advancedmode">Advanced Mode</h4>

<p>MultiMarkdown version 2.0 had to first convert the source file to XHTML, and
then applied XSLT files to convert to the final LaTeX format. Since
MultiMarkdown 3.0 can create LaTeX directly, this approach is no longer
necessary.</p>

<p>The one benefit of that approach, however, was that it became possible to
perform a wide range of customizations on exactly how the LaTeX output was
created by customizing the XSLT files.</p>

<p>If you install the Support files on Mac or Linux, you can still use the
advanced XSLT method to generate LaTeX output. For the time being, this
approach doesn&#8217;t work with Windows, but it would be fairly easy to create a
batch script or perl script to implement this feature on Windows.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, however, that because of the more advanced mechanism of handling
LaTeX in MultiMarkdown 3.0, you can do a great deal of customization without
needing to use an XSLT file.</p>

<p>The <code>mmd2xslt</code> script will convert a plain text file into LaTeX that is
virtually identical with that created by the regular LaTeX approach.</p>

<p>There are a few differences in the two approaches, however:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Once a MultiMarkdown file is converted to XHTML, it is impossible to tell
 whether the resulting HTML was generated by MultiMarkdown, or if it was
 included as raw XHTML within the source document. So <em>either</em> way, it will
 be converted to the analagous LaTeX syntax. The <code>multimarkdown</code> binary on
 its own will <em>not</em> convert XHTML into LaTeX.</p></li>
<li><p>The whitespace that is generated will be different under certain
 circumstances. Typically, this will result in one extra or one fewer blank
 lines with the the XSLT approach. Generally this will not be an issue, but
 when used with <code>&lt;!-- some comment --&gt;</code> it may cause a newline to be lost.</p></li>
<li><p>The default XSLT recognizes <code>class=&quot;noxslt&quot;</code> when applied to XHTML entities,
 and will discard them from the output.</p></li>
<li><p>An XSLT can only be applied to a complete XHTML document, not a &#8220;snippet&#8221;.
 Therefore, if you want to use the XSLT method, your file must have metadata
 that triggers a complete document (i.e. any metadata except &#8220;quotes
 language&#8221; or &#8220;base header level&#8221;).</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h4>

<p>I recommend that you become familiar with the &#8220;basic&#8221; approach to using
MultiMarkdown before trying to experiment with XSLT. The basic approach is
faster, and easier, and the results can still be customized quite a bit.</p>

<p>Then you can experiment with modifying XSLT to further customize your output
as needed.</p>

<p>If you have XSLT files that you used in MultiMarkdown 2.0, you will likely
need to modify them to recognize the XHTML output generated by MultiMarkdown
3.0. You can use the default XSLT files as a guide to what is different.</p>

<h3 id="macosxapplications">Mac OS X Applications</h3>

<p>There are several applications that have built-in support for MultiMarkdown,
or that can easily use it with a plug-in.</p>

<h4 id="usingmultimarkdownwithtextmate">Using MultiMarkdown with TextMate</h4>

<p>If you want to run MultiMarkdown from directly within <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>, you should
install my MultiMarkdown <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/markdown.tmbundle">bundle</a>. This is a modified version of the original
Markdown bundle for TextMate that includes better support for MultiMarkdown.</p>

<p>This bundle will work with MultiMarkdown 2.0, or with MultiMarkdown 3.0 if you
install the MultiMarkdown-Support files (available from the downloads
<a href="https://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown/downloads/">page</a>).</p>

<h4 id="usingmultimarkdownwithscrivener">Using MultiMarkdown with Scrivener</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/">Scrivener</a> is a great program for writers using Mac OS X. It includes built
in support for MultiMarkdown. If you want to use MultiMarkdown 3.0 with
Scrivener, you need to install the Support files in <code>~/Library/Application
Support/MultiMarkdown</code>. The MultiMarkdown-Support installer is available from
the downloads <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown/downloads/">page</a> and will install these files for you.</p>

<h4 id="draganddrop">Drag and Drop</h4>

<p>You can use the Mac OS X drag and drop applications to allow you to convert
MultiMarkdown to other formats by dragging and dropping files in the Finder.
They are available from the <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown/downloads/">downloads</a> page, or by running <code>make drop</code> from
the command line in the <code>multimarkdown</code> source directory.</p>

<h4 id="multimarkdownandfinderquicklook">MultiMarkdown and Finder &#8220;Quick Look&#8221;</h4>

<p>Starting in Mac OS 10.5, the Finder has the ability to show a &#8220;Quick Look&#8221;
preview of the contents of a file. I have two Quick Look generators that allow
the finder to preview the contents of a MultiMarkdown text file as an XHTML
preview. One works on plain text files, and one works on OPML files.</p>

<p>Available for download from <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/qlmultimarkdown/downloads">github</a>.</p>

<h3 id="usingmultimarkdowninwindows">Using MultiMarkdown in Windows</h3>

<p>You can use the same command line approach with Windows as described
previously. While there aren&#8217;t drag and drop applications per se for the
Windows system, you can use Windows Explorer to create links to the binary and
specify and desired command line options to change the default output format.
This will effectively allow you to create drag and drop applications for
Windows.</p>

<h3 id="multimarkdownandlatex">MultiMarkdown and LaTeX</h3>

<p>Of note <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a> is a complex set of programs. MultiMarkdown doesn&#8217;t include
LaTeX in the installer &#8212; it&#8217;s up to the user to install a working LaTeX
setup on their machine if you want to use it.</p>

<p>What MultiMarkdown does is make it easier to generate documents using the
LaTeX syntax. It should handle 80% of the documents that 80% of MultiMarkdown
need. It doesn&#8217;t handle all circumstances, and sometimes you will need to hand
code your LaTeX yourself.</p>

<p>In those cases you have a few options. MultiMarkdown will pass text included
in XHTML comments along to the LaTeX as raw output. For example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!--  This is raw \LaTeX \[ {e}^{i\pi }+1=0 \] --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can also include your desired LaTeX code in a separate file and link to
it:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- \input{somefile} --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you have questions about LaTeX itself, I can&#8217;t help. You&#8217;re welcome to send
your question to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/multimarkdown/">MultiMarkdown Discussion List</a>, and perhaps someone will
be able to offer some assistance. But you would be better off asking a group
dedicated to LaTeX instead.</p>

<p>If the problem is that MultiMarkdown itself is generating invalid LaTeX, then
of course I want to know about it so I can fix it.</p>

<h3 id="multimarkdownandopml">MultiMarkdown and OPML</h3>

<p>MultiMarkdown is well suited to plain text files, but it can also be useful to
work on MultiMarkdown documents in an outliner. For this, it is easy to
convert back and forth between OPML and plain text MultiMarkdown.</p>

<p>To convert from a text file to OPML:</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown -t opml -b file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>or:</p>

<pre><code>mmd2opml file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>The resulting OPML file uses the headings to build the outline structure, and
puts the text within each section as a not for the corresponding level of the
outline using the <code>_note</code> attribute. <strong>NOTE</strong>: not all outliners support this
attribute. On Mac OS X, <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/">OmniOutliner</a> is a fabulous outliner
that supports this field. If you&#8217;re into mind mapping software, <a href="http://www.ithoughts.co.uk/">iThoughts</a> works on the iPad/iPhone and supports import and
export with OPML and the <code>_note</code> attribute.</p>

<p>To convert from OPML, you can use various commands in from the <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/MMD-Support">MMD-Support</a> package:</p>

<pre><code>opml2XHTML file.opml
opml2mmd file.opml
opml2LaTeX file.opml
</code></pre>

<h3 id="multimarkdownandopendocument">MultiMarkdown and OpenDocument</h3>

<p>It is also possible to convert a MultiMarkdown text file into a word
processing document for <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org</a> or
<a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/download">LibreOffice</a>. This file can then be
converted by one of those applications into RTF, or a Microsoft Word document,
or many other file formats. (If you&#8217;re not familiar with these applications,
they are worth checking out. I don&#8217;t understand why people use Microsoft
Office any more&#8230;)</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown -b -t odf file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>mmd2odf file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>MultiMarkdown 2.0 had partial support for outputting an RTF file, and could do
it completely on Mac OS X by using Apple&#8217;s <code>textutil</code> program. MMD 3 no longer
directly supports RTF as an output format, but the Flat OpenDocument format is
a much better option.</p>

<h4 id="advanceduse">Advanced Use</h4>

<p>It is possible to use an XSLT file to customize the OpenDocument output from
MultiMarkdown. I suppose you could write an XSLT to convert OpenDocument into
LaTeX, similar to the default ones that convert XHTML into LaTeX.</p>

<p>You can also create an XSLT that converts the OpenDocument output and modifies
it to incorporate necessary customizations. While a little tricky to learn,
XSLT files can be quite powerful and you&#8217;re limited only by your imagination.</p>

<h4 id="limitations">Limitations</h4>

<p>There are several limitations to this format:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>images are not supported &#8212; instead a placeholder is inserted and you can
 manually insert the image in its place</p></li>
<li><p>citations are not supported &#8212; I would like to be able to do something
 here, but I suspect you will need to use an external tool for the time
 being</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="howdoicreateamultimarkdowndocument">How do I create a MultiMarkdown document?</h2>

<p>The general concept in MultiMarkdown is that it should be easy for someone to
type a plain text file that is human-readable, and then use the MultiMarkdown
program to convert that text file into a more complicated computer language
such as XHTML or LaTeX. This allows you to create high quality output without
having to spend hours and hours fiddling with font sizes, margins, etc.</p>

<p>The first step in learning to use MultiMarkdown is to learn how to use
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. MultiMarkdown is an
extension to Markdown, and builds off of the basic fundamentals used in
Markdown.</p>

<p>I recommend starting by familiarizing yourself with the Markdown <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics">basics</a> and
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">syntax</a> pages.</p>

<p>Once you&#8217;re familiar with the basics of Markdown, it will be relatively easy
to pick up the advanced features included in MultiMarkdown.</p>

<h3 id="metadata">Metadata</h3>

<p>It is possible to include special metadata at the top of a MultiMarkdown
document, such as title, author, etc. This information can then be used to
control how MultiMarkdown processes the document, or can be used in certain
output formats in special ways.</p>

<pre><code>Title:   A Sample MultiMarkdown Document  
Author:  Fletcher T. Penney  
Date:    February 9, 2011  
Comment: This is a comment intended to demonstrate  
         metadata that spans multiple lines, yet  
         is treated as a single value.  
Test:    And this is a new key-value pair  
</code></pre>

<p>The syntax for including metadata is simple.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The metadata must begin at the very top of the document - no blank lines can
 precede it.</p></li>
<li><p>Metadata consists of the two parts - the <code>key</code> and the <code>value</code></p></li>
<li><p>The metadata key must begin at the beginning of the line. It must start with
 a letter or number, then the following characters can consist of letters,
 numbers, spaces, hyphens, or underscore characters.</p></li>
<li><p>The end of the metadata key is specified with a colon (&#8216;:&#8217;)</p></li>
<li><p>After the colon comes the metadata value, which can consist of pretty much
 any characters (including new lines). To keep multiline metadata values from
 being confused with additional metadata, I recommend indenting each new line
 of metadata. If your metadata value includes a colon, it <em>must</em> be indented
 to keep it from being treated as a new key-value pair.</p></li>
<li><p>While not required, I recommend using two spaces at the end of each line of
 metadata. This will improve the appearance of the metadata section if your
 document is processed by Markdown instead of MultiMarkdown.</p></li>
<li><p>Metadata keys are case insensitive and stripped of all spaces during
 processing. This means that <code>Base Header Level</code>, <code>base headerlevel</code>, and
 <code>baseheaderlevel</code> are all the same.</p></li>
<li><p>Metadata is processed as plain text, so it should <em>not</em> include
 MultiMarkdown markup. It is possible to create customized XSLT files that
 apply certain processing to the metadata value, but this is not the default
 behavior.</p></li>
<li><p>After the metadata is finished, a blank line triggers the beginning of the
 rest of the document.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="completedocumentsvssnippets">Complete documents vs &#8220;snippets&#8221;</h3>

<p>In order to include metadata information such as a title, the XHTML document
created by MultiMarkdown must be &#8220;complete.&#8221; This means that it starts with
something that looks like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; ?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN&quot;
    &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you include metadata in your document (with two exceptions), then you will
generate a complete document. If you don&#8217;t include metadata, then you will
instead generate a &#8220;snippet.&#8221; The snippet will just include the relevant
portion of XHTML, but will not include the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> elements.</p>

<p>Metadata that is only intended to affect the way MultiMarkdown process the
output will not trigger a complete document. Currently, this means you can use
<code>Base Header Level</code> or <code>Quotes Language</code> and still output a snippet if you
don&#8217;t include any other metadata.</p>

<p>Document formats other than XHTML don&#8217;t have distinctions between complete
documents and snippets. Any included and relevant metadata will be included if
present.</p>

<h3 id="standardmetadatakeys">&#8220;Standard&#8221; Metadata keys</h3>

<p>There are a few metadata keys that are standardized in MultiMarkdown. You can
use any other keys that you desire, but you have to make use of them yourself.</p>

<p>My goal is to keep the list of &#8220;standard&#8221; metadata keys as short as possible.</p>

<h4 id="author">Author</h4>

<p>This value represents the author of the document and is used in LaTeX
documents to generate the title information.</p>

<h4 id="affiliation">Affiliation</h4>

<p>This is used to enter further information about the author &#8212; a link to a
website, an employer, academic affiliation, etc.</p>

<h4 id="baseheaderlevel">Base Header Level</h4>

<p>This is used to change the top level of organization of the document. For example:</p>

<pre><code>Base Header Level: 2

# Introduction #
</code></pre>

<p>Normally, the Introduction would be output as <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> in XHTML, or <code>\part{}</code> in
LaTeX. If you&#8217;re writing a shorter document, you may wish for the largest
division in the document to be <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> or <code>\chapter{}</code>. The <code>Base Header Level</code>
metadata tells MultiMarkdown to change the largest division level to the
specified value.</p>

<p>This can also be useful when combining multiple documents.</p>

<p><code>Base Header Level</code> does not trigger a complete document.</p>

<p>Additionally, there are &#8220;flavors&#8221; of this metadata key for various output
formats so that you can specify a different header level for different output
formats &#8212; i.e. <code>LaTeX Header Level</code>, <code>XHTML Header Level</code>, and <code>ODF Header
Level</code>.</p>

<h4 id="copyright">Copyright</h4>

<p>This can be used to provide a copyright string.</p>

<h4 id="css">CSS</h4>

<p>This metadata specifies a URL to be used as a CSS file for the produced
document. Obviously, this is only useful when outputting to XHTML.</p>

<h4 id="date">Date</h4>

<p>Specify a date to be associated with the document.</p>

<h4 id="quoteslanguage">Quotes Language</h4>

<p>This is used to specify which style of &#8220;smart&#8221; quotes to use in the output document. The available options are:</p>

<ul>
<li>dutch</li>
<li>english</li>
<li>french</li>
<li>german</li>
<li>germanguillemets</li>
<li>swedish</li>
</ul>

<p>The default is <code>english</code> if not specified. This affects XHTML output. To
change the language of a document in LaTeX is up to the individual.</p>

<p><code>Quotes Language</code> does not trigger a complete document.</p>

<h4 id="latexfooter">LaTeX Footer</h4>

<p>A special case of the <code>LaTeX Input</code> metadata below. This file will be linked
to at the very end of the document.</p>

<h4 id="latexinput">LaTeX Input</h4>

<p>When outputting a LaTeX document it is necessary to include various directions
that specify how the document should be formatted. These are not included in
the MultiMarkdown document itself &#8212; instead they should be stored separately
and linked to with <code>\input{file}</code> commands.</p>

<p>These links can be included in the metadata section. The metadata is processed
in order, so I generally break my directives into a group that need to go
before my metadata, a group that goes after the metadata but before the
document itself, and a separate group that goes at the end of the document,
for example:</p>

<pre><code>latex input:        mmd-memoir-header
Title:              MultiMarkdown Example
Base Header Level:  2
latex mode:         memoir
latex input:        mmd-memoir-begin-doc
latex footer:       mmd-memoir-footer
</code></pre>

<p>You can download the <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown-latex-support">LaTeX Support</a> files if you want to output documents
using the default MultiMarkdown styles. You can then use these as examples to
create your own customized LaTeX output.</p>

<p>TODO: include more details about this</p>

<h4 id="latexmode">LaTeX Mode</h4>

<p>When outputting a document to LaTeX, there are two special options that change
the output slightly &#8212; <code>memoir</code> and <code>beamer</code>. These options are designed to
be compatible with the LaTeX classes of the same names.</p>

<h4 id="odfheader">ODF Header</h4>

<p>You can include raw XML to be included in the header of a file output in
OpenDocument format. It&#8217;s up to you to properly format your XML and get it
working &#8212; MultiMarkdown just copies it verbatim to the output.</p>

<h4 id="title">Title</h4>

<p>Self-explanatory.</p>

<h4 id="xhtmlheader">XHTML Header</h4>

<p>You can include raw XHTML information to be included in the header.
MultiMarkdown doesn&#8217;t perform any validation on this data &#8212; it just copies
it as is.</p>

<p>As an example, this can be useful to link your document to a working MathJax installation (not provided by me):</p>

<pre><code>xhtml header:  &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;
    src=&quot;http://example.net/mathjax/MathJax.js&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>MultiMarkdown 2.0 used <a href="http://www1.chapman.edu/~jipsen/mathml/asciimath.html">ASCIIMathML</a> to typeset mathematical equations. There
were benefits to using ASCIIMathML, but also some disadvantages.</p>

<p>When rewriting for MultiMarkdown 3.0, there was no straightforward way to
implement ASCIIMathML which lead me to look for alternatives. I settled on
using <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>. The advantage here is that the same syntax is supported by
MathJax in browsers, and in LaTeX. </p>

<p>This does mean that math will need to be entered into MultiMarkdown documents
using the LaTeX syntax, rather than ASCIIMathML.</p>

<p>To enable MathJax support in web pages, you have to include a link to an
active MathJax installation &#8212; setting this up is beyond the scope of this
document, but it&#8217;s not too hard.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an example of the metadata setup, and some math:</p>

<pre><code>latex input:    mmd-article-header  
Title:          MultiMarkdown Math Example  
latex input:    mmd-article-begin-doc  
latex footer:   mmd-memoir-footer  
xhtml header:   &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;
    src=&quot;http://example.net/mathjax/MathJax.js&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/script&gt;


An example of math within a paragraph --- \\({e}^{i\pi }+1=0\\)
--- easy enough.

And an equation on it's own:

\\[ {x}_{1,2}=\frac{-b\pm \sqrt{{b}^{2}-4ac}}{2a} \\]

That's it.
</code></pre>

<p>Here&#8217;s what it looks like in action:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An example of math within a paragraph &#8212; <span class="math">\({e}^{i\pi }+1=0\)</span>
&#8212; easy enough.</p>

<p>And an equation on it&#8217;s own:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[ {x}_{1,2}=\frac{-b\pm \sqrt{{b}^{2}-4ac}}{2a} \]</span></p>

<p>That&#8217;s it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TODO: This doesn&#8217;t quite work properly in github wiki</p>

<h3 id="glossary">Glossary</h3>

<h3 id="rawxhtml">Raw XHTML</h3>

<p>You can include raw (X)HTML within your document. Exactly what happens with
these portions depends on the output format. You can also use the <code>markdown</code>
attribute to indicate that MultiMarkdown processing should be applied within
the block level HTML tag. This is in addition to the <code>--process-html</code> command
line option that causes MultiMarkdown processing to occur within <em>all</em> block
level HTML tags.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;This is *not* MultiMarkdown&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div markdown=1&gt;This *is* MultiMarkdown&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>will produce the following without <code>--process-html</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;This is *not* MultiMarkdown&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;This &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; MultiMarkdown&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and with <code>--process-html</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; MultiMarkdown&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;This &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; MultiMarkdown&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, the results may be different than anticipated when outputting to
LaTeX or other formats. Normally, block level HTML will be ignored when
outputting to LaTeX. The example above would produce the following, leaving
out the first <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> entirely:</p>

<pre><code>This \emph{is} MultiMarkdown
</code></pre>

<p>And this with <code>--process-html</code>:</p>

<pre><code>This is \emph{not} MultiMarkdown
This \emph{is} MultiMarkdown
</code></pre>

<p>You will also notice that the line breaks are different when outputting to
LaTeX, and this can cause the contents of two <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags to be placed into a
single paragraph.</p>

<h2 id="multimarkdownoutputformats">MultiMarkdown Output Formats</h2>

<p>MultiMarkdown can output to various formats. The default behavior for each
format should be pretty good, but each format does have it&#8217;s own unique
characteristics that sometimes need adjustment.</p>

<h3 id="xhtml">XHTML</h3>

<p>XHTML is the &#8220;default&#8221; format for outputting MultiMarkdown documents, so it&#8217;s
behavior is generally the most predictable.</p>

<h3 id="latex">LaTeX</h3>

<p>LaTeX is the second oldest output format for MultiMarkdown, so many issues
have been worked out.</p>

<h3 id="opendocument">OpenDocument</h3>

<p>OpenDocument Text, or more specifically Flat XML or <code>.fodt</code>, is a newer format
for MultiMarkdown, so there may still be a few kinks to be worked out.</p>

<h4 id="images">Images</h4>

<p>When outputting to OpenDocument, images are &#8220;linked&#8221; to in much the same way
as when creating XHTML. The images are not actually embedded in the document
itself by default. This means, that if you wanted to share the document with
someone else, you would also have to share the images.</p>

<p>The advantage is that the images will automatically be updated if the original
is changed.</p>

<p>If you want to embed the images into the document, then you can use the
<code>Edit:Links:Break Link</code> menu item (or something similar depending on your
application) to embed each image as desired.</p>

<h4 id="imagesize">Image size</h4>

<p>Images work best in OpenDocument when both a height and width attribute are
specified. If only a width or height is specified, then things will work, but
the image might not look correct.x</p>

<h3 id="opml">OPML</h3>

<p>OPML, or Outline Processor Markup Language, is a basic format that is useful
for importing and exporting from various outlining programs (e.g
<a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/">OmniOutliner</a>). When
used with MultiMarkdown, you can switch back and forth from an outliner and
text editor as necessary to work on a document. The text editor will likely be
easier for writing your prose, and the outliner may be easier when rearranging
the structure of your document.</p>

<h4 id="irregularhierarchyissues">&#8220;Irregular&#8221; hierarchy issues</h4>

<p>When using an Outliner, each level in the document (e.g. <code>h1</code>, <code>h2</code>, etc.) is
a child of a parent that is one level &#8220;higher&#8221; than the child. For example:</p>

<pre><code>## Second Level ##

### Third level ###

This is a child of the level 2 parent, &quot;Second Level&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>It causes problems if you were to try and &#8220;skip&#8221; a level:</p>

<pre><code>## Second Level ##

#### Fourth level ####

This is *not* a child of the level 2 parent, &quot;Second Level&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>If you use the <code>multimarkdown</code> to process a text file containing such &#8220;skips&#8221;
into an OPML, any &#8220;orphaned&#8221; levels will not be included in the output.</p>

<h4 id="non-asciicharactersrequirecompletedocument">Non-ASCII characters require complete document</h4>

<p>In order for Non-ASCII characters to display properly in most browsers, there
needs to be some indication of the character set being used. Without getting
into too many technical details, the easiest way to get XHTML output to
display properly is to include metadata that will trigger a complete document,
e.g. a <code>Title</code>.</p>

<h3 id="html">HTML</h3>

<h3 id="latex">LaTeX</h3>

<h3 id="opml">OPML</h3>

<h4 id="nonsequentialheaderlevels">Nonsequential Header Levels</h4>

<p>If you plan on converting a MultiMarkdown document into OPML, the various
header levels (e.g. <code>h1</code>, <code>h2</code>, etc) must be sequential. In other words, if a
level 3 heading is a &#8220;child&#8221; of a level 1 heading, it will not appear in the
OPML file. I may fix this down the road, but I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s going to be
worth the hassle. If you need to have these non-sequential headings, you can
use the old <code>mmd2OPML.pl</code> script to convert to OPML instead.</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<p>Answers to common questions about MultiMarkdown. Contributions welcome!</p>

<h3 id="howdoiinstallmmd">How do I install MMD?</h3>

<h4 id="macosx">Mac OS X</h4>

<p>On the Mac, you can choose from using an installer to install the program and
required library for you, or you can compile it yourself from scratch. If you
know what that means, follow the instructions below in the Linux section.
Otherwise, definitely go for the installer!</p>

<p>Go to the <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown/downloads/">downloads</a> page to get the installer.</p>

<h4 id="windows">Windows</h4>

<p>The easiest way to get peg-multimarkdown running on Windows is to download the
precompiled binary from the <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown/downloads/">downloads</a> page. There&#8217;s a bat file you can run
that will move the included dll files, the executable, and a couple of
convenience scripts to <code>C:\WINDOWS\system32</code>. If there&#8217;s an easy way to make a
proper installer, I am open to the idea, but only if it&#8217;s pretty easy to do
(preferably from the command line!). Also, if I should be installing these
files somewhere else, please let me know.</p>

<p>If you want to compile this yourself, you do it in the same way that you would
install peg-markdown for Windows. The instructions are on the
peg-multimarkdown
<a href="https://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown/wiki/Building-for-Windows">wiki</a>.
I was able to compile for Windows fairly easily using Ubuntu linux following
those instructions. I have not tried to actually compile on a Windows machine.</p>

<p>(For those who are interested, I actually created an EC2 instance on Amazon
and installed the necessary software to compile. It was pretty easy and
probably cost me $0.02&#8230;)</p>

<p>Once you have the binary compiled, you can use the <code>windows-installer</code> branch
and the <code>make installer</code> command to package the files in the
<code>windows_installer</code> directory into a zip file for use as a make-shift
installation package.</p>

<h4 id="linux">Linux</h4>

<p>The easiest way is probably to compile it yourself. You need to have <code>glib2</code>
installed. For example, on ubuntu:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev
</code></pre>

<p>For other linux distributions, you will need to do something similar.</p>

<p>On Mac OS X, please note that you will need to install the Developer Tools.
You then need to install a few libraries. I used <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew">homebrew</a>:</p>

<pre><code>brew install pkg-config glib gettext
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use <a href="http://www.finkproject.org/">fink</a> or something similar (though this caused some machine
architecture incompatibilities):</p>

<pre><code>fink install glib2-shlibs glib2-dev
</code></pre>

<p>Once you have the libraries installed, you can either download the source from
<a href="https://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown">peg-multimarkdown</a>, or (preferentially) you can use git:</p>

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown.git
</code></pre>

<p>Then, simply run <code>make</code> to compile the source. You can also run some test
commands to verify that everything is working properly. Of note, it is normal
to fail one test in the Markdown tests, but the others should pass. You can
then install the binary wherever you like.</p>

<pre><code>make
make test
make mmdtest
make latextest
</code></pre>

<p>If you&#8217;re on a Mac, and want to make your own installer, you can run <code>make
installer</code> if you use the <code>mac-installer</code> branch of the github project. Then
open the <code>Make OS X Installer</code> file and build the installer using the
<code>PackageMaker</code> application.</p>

<h3 id="howcanibetterlearnthemultimarkdownsyntax">How can I better learn the MultiMarkdown Syntax?</h3>

<p>The syntax of MultiMarkdown can be a challenge for beginners especially when it comes to using Table and Link syntax. The challenge comes in understanding how it looks <em>after</em> the conversion. </p>

<p>For Mac users, you can download a free program NValt <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/code/">http://brettterpstra.com/code/</a> that contains a preview mode. Thus, you can enter your markdown with a dynamic preview window to show how the formatting appears. I&#8217;ve found this useful until I was comfortable with the syntax. </p>

<p>Note also that MultiMarkdown can also be installed to MarsEdit <a href="http://red-sweater.com/marsedit/">http://red-sweater.com/marsedit/</a> which also has a preview mode. This is even more effective for for bloggers as it will handle inline image upload to most popular blog software and display the interpreted output of your MMD syntax. </p>

<p>&#8211;I don&#8217;t know of any Windows software that does the same&#8211;</p>

<h4 id="webbasedlearning">Web Based Learning</h4>

<p>For absolute beginners to Markdown, you may want to try [[http://peg.gd/]] which provides a web site for writing in Markdown syntax and display. You can also save the pages for forwarding to other people. </p>

<p>For the reverse requirement, you can visit [[http://heckyesmarkdown.com/]] which will attempt to take a given HTML Page and convert it into Markdown, usually with good accuracy.</p>

<h3 id="caniusemultimarkdownonaniphoneipad">Can I use MultiMarkdown on an iPhone/iPad?</h3>

<p>There are a number of programs available for use on the iPhone and iPad that
support regular Markdown, but not MultiMarkdown.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.secondgearsoftware.com/elements/">Elements</a> is a iPhone / iPad app
that also has a markdown preview mode. Second Gear has also made
<a href="http://www.secondgearsoftware.com/markdownmail/">MarkdownMail</a> which is
simpler, but also very usable for learning Markdown.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.textasticapp.com/">Textastic</a> is a syntax highlighting text editor
for the iPad that includes a preview mode for Markdown. It will even preview
MathJax equations if you include the proper metadata!</p>

<p>Now that MultiMarkdown is available in C (as of version 3.0), I would like to
work on modifying it to work with iOS.</p>

have trouble.</p>

<h3 id="latex">My LaTeX won&#8217;t compile &#8212; what&#8217;s wrong?</h3>

<p>First - the vast majority of the time, this is not really a MMD problem, but
rather a LaTeX problem, or (honestly) user error. Very occasionally, there are
instances where MMD produces invalid LaTeX output when given unusual input,
but these are rare.</p>

<p>First, if you are having problems with a more &#8220;complicated&#8221; MMD tool (such as
the TextMate bundle, or the Drag and Drop versions), use the command line
approach when you are really having difficulties. See if your document will
compile to XHTML using the <code>MultiMarkdown.pl</code> utility. Once you&#8217;ve got that
working, try moving on to LaTeX, and then a PDF (if that&#8217;s your goal).</p>

<p>If that doesn&#8217;t work, you need to track down the source of the error. The best
approach is similar to the old program Conflict Catcher. Keep dividing your
document into halves, and test each half. One half will likely compile without
complaint, and the other won&#8217;t. Take the problem half, and repeat this process
until you are able to find the paragraph, sentence, word that causes the
error.</p>

<p>Using a real text editor (e.g. <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>), examine
the trouble section and make sure to view the invisible characters, and look
for something odd. If you can&#8217;t do that, you can also delete the faulty
sentence and retype it (<em>don&#8217;t</em> copy and paste &#8212; you&#8217;ll simply replicate the
problem).</p>

<p>If none of that fixes your problem, post the problem section to the
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/multimarkdown">MultiMarkdown Discussion List</a>
and you will likely find out what you&#8217;re doing wrong. Or perhaps you found an
error and I will fix it. ;)</p>

<h3 id="meta">When I try to convert to XHTML, my document ends up in the metadata</h3>

<p>You are using an automated tool to create &#8220;complete&#8221; content. The tool is
adding the <code>format: complete</code> metadata for you, but you don&#8217;t have any other
metadata in your document.</p>

<p>Start your document with a blank line to indicate that there is no more
metadata.</p>

<h3 id="whyisthedraganddropversionofmmdformaconly">Why is the Drag and Drop version of MMD for Mac only?</h3>

<p>Because that&#8217;s what I use, and because
<a href="http://www.sveinbjorn.org/platypus">Platypus</a> made it really easy to create a
GUI for a shell script.</p>

<p>Anyone is welcome to create something similar for any OS they choose.</p>

<h3 id="whatideasaretheforthefutureofmultimarkdown">What ideas are the for the future of MultiMarkdown?</h3>

<h4 id="morecomplexsyntaxfortables">More complex syntax for tables</h4>

<p>Several users have written with suggestions for additional syntax for tables
in order to allow cells to span multiple rows, to allow the MMD source for a
single table row to span multiple text rows, etc.</p>

<p>My concern here is that the table should be easily understood in plain text,
without too much markup. Ideally, there would be no markup, but it&#8217;s just too
complicated to have MMD figure out what the layout means.</p>

<p>I welcome suggestions, but I plan to be somewhat strict on this one&#8230;. And
remember, for complex tables you can always enter the raw HTML.</p>

<h4 id="asyntaxforaddingforms">A syntax for adding forms?</h4>

<p>This is less likely to happen, but it seems that adding some sort of basic
syntax to manage forms would be pretty easy, and not very intrusive. Something
like:</p>

<pre><code>Please check all that apply:

[ ] Option A
[ ] Option B
[ ] Option C

Please choose one of the following:

( ) Option A
( ) Option B
( ) Option C

Please enter your first name:

[_______________________]
</code></pre>

<p>The idea would be to allow you to easily enter the necessary fields for a
form, but not have to be concerned with the XHTML nonsense&#8230;. As always,
input welcome.</p>
