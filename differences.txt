# Differences from original MMD #

This is a list of known differences from the original MMD syntax, followed by
the priority of changing it back.

* Footnotes are anchored based on number, rather than the label used in the
  MMD source. (low priority)

* Footnote "return" links are a separate paragraph (low priority)

* Footnote numbers are surrounded by "[]" in the output (intentional change)
